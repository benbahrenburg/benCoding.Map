<h1>benCoding.Map</h1>
 
Welcome to the benCoding.Map Titanium project.

This project is a fork of the iOS Titanium Native Map module.  The goal of this project is to add Polgyon overlay support.

<h2>Features</h2>

This module provides Polgyon overlay support in addition to all of the same features contained within the native Titanium Map module and also UserTracking functionality.

For a list of all the features supported by the Titanium Map module, please reference the documentation [here](http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/2.1/index.html#!/api/Titanium.Map.View).

<h2>See it in action</h2>
<b>[View our gallery]</b>(https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.Map/blob/master/samples.md) to see many of our features in action.

<h2>Before you start</h2>
* You need Titanium 1.8.2 or greater.
* This module will only work with iOS 5 or great.  

<h2>Setup</h2>

* Download the latest release from the [dist folder](https://github.com/benbahrenburg/benCoding.Map/tree/master/dist) or you can build it yourself 
* Install the bencoding.map module. If you need help here is a "How To" [guide](https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/guides/Configuring+Apps+to+Use+Modules). 
* You can now use the module via the commonJS require method, example shown below.

<pre><code>
